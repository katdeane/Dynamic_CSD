## This repo contains the CSD Analysis for Mawaheb Kassir's PV Cre project

Good Git practices:
***
	1. Write good commit messages
		* Because we should be able to skim the list of changes and retrace steps
	2. Write good variable names
		* Increases readability
	3. Make small commits when possible
		* Summarize the change in a sentence or phrase - Increases readability of tracking
		* If you feel the commit message is too long, instead split it to several commits
	4. Before you Push all of your code changes, Pull the online directory to sync locally 
		* This will massively simplify any merge conflicts that arise as you will be able to handle them locally
	5. Make experimental changes in branches before messing with the master
		* Because people are using the master and it should continue to function 
	6. Request a merge with the master 
        	* So that at least one other member must double-check changes 
	7. Write good messages when assigning tasks to other users
	8. Write good documentation explaining your functions
		* Input, output, folder paths, and if necessary the shape of data input
	9. UPDATE documentation in functions if you altered the function
